**How to Run**


Firstly run add_faces.py , where user is prompted to enter their name, which is associated with the collected face data. The system captures and stores this data for future use in face recognition tasks. 

Then run test.py which captures real-time video, detects faces, recognizes them using a pre-trained model, displays the results, and records attendance data into a file.

Then run app.py where attendace of user is noted in csv file with his name in it, capturing his face in real time video and detecting it using pretrained model.
